# Line Follower Robot using 8-Channel IR Sensor 🤖🛣️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Line Follower Robot** using an **8-channel IR sensor array** and a microcontroller.  
The robot detects and follows a black line on a white surface (or vice-versa) with **high accuracy**, even on curves and sharp turns.

Using 8 IR sensors provides better line detection, stability, and control compared to basic 2-sensor or 4-sensor designs.

## 🧠 Working Principle
- Each IR sensor detects whether the surface below it is **black (line)** or **white (background)**.
- The sensor array continuously sends digital signals to the microcontroller.
- Based on the sensor pattern, the controller decides:
  - Move forward
  - Turn left
  - Turn right
- Motor speed and direction are adjusted to keep the robot aligned with the line.

Using multiple sensors allows smoother turns, better curve handling, and improved accuracy.

## 🔌 Sensor Logic (Example)
`1` → Line detected  
`0` → No line detected  

| Sensor Pattern | Robot Action |
|---------------|--------------|
| 00011000 | Move Forward |
| 00001100 | Slight Right |
| 00110000 | Slight Left |
| 00000110 | Sharp Right |
| 01100000 | Sharp Left |
| 00000000 | Stop / Line Lost |
